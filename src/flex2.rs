/// A container with either horizontal or vertical layout.
///
/// This widget is the foundation of most layouts, and is highly configurable.
///
/// # Flex layout algorithm
///
/// Children of a `Flex` container can have an optional `flex` parameter.
/// Layout occurs in several passes. First we measure (calling their [`layout`]
/// method) our non-flex children, providing them with unbounded space on the
/// main axis. Next, the remaining space is divided between the flex children
/// according to their flex factor, and they are measured. Unlike a non-flex
/// child, a child with a non-zero flex factor has a maximum allowed size
/// on the main axis; non-flex children are allowed to choose their size first,
/// and freely.
///
/// If you would like a child to be forced to use up all of the flex space
/// passed to it, you can place it in a [`SizedBox`] set to `expand` in the
/// appropriate axis. There are convenience methods for this available on
/// [`WidgetExt`]: [`expand_width`] and [`expand_height`].
///
/// # Flex or non-flex?
///
/// When should your children be flexible? With other things being equal,
/// a flexible child has lower layout priority than a non-flexible child.
/// Imagine, for instance, we have a row that is 30dp wide, and we have
/// two children, both of which want to be 20dp wide. If child #1 is non-flex
/// and child #2 is flex, the first widget will take up its 20dp, and the second
/// widget will be constrained to 10dp.
///
/// If, instead, both widgets are flex, they will each be given equal space,
/// and both will end up taking up 15dp.
///
/// If both are non-flex they will both take up 20dp, and will overflow the
/// container.
///
/// ```no_compile
///  -------non-flex----- -flex-----
/// |       child #1     | child #2 |
///
///
///  ----flex------- ----flex-------
/// |    child #1   |    child #2   |
///
/// ```
///
/// In general, if you are using widgets that are opinionated about their size
/// (such as most control widgets, which are designed to lay out nicely together,
/// or text widgets that are sized to fit their text) you should make them
/// non-flexible.
///
/// If you are trying to divide space evenly, or if you want a particular item
/// to have access to all left over space, then you should make it flexible.
///
/// **note**: by default, a widget will not necessarily use all the space that
/// is available to it. For instance, the [`TextBox`] widget has a default
/// width, and will choose this width if possible, even if more space is
/// available to it. If you want to force a widget to use all available space,
/// you should expand it, with [`expand_width`] or [`expand_height`].
///
///
/// # Options
///
/// To experiment with these options, see the `flex` example in `druid/examples`.
///
/// - [`CrossAxisAlignment`] determines how children are positioned on the
/// cross or 'minor' axis. The default is `CrossAxisAlignment::Center`.
///
/// - [`MainAxisAlignment`] determines how children are positioned on the main
/// axis; this is only meaningful if the container has more space on the main
/// axis than is taken up by its children.
///
/// - [`must_fill_main_axis`] determines whether the container is obliged to
/// be maximally large on the major axis, as determined by its own constraints.
/// If this is `true`, then the container must fill the available space on that
/// axis; otherwise it may be smaller if its children are smaller.
///
/// Additional options can be set (or overridden) in the [`FlexParams`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Construction with builder methods
///
/// ```
/// use druid::widget::{Flex, FlexParams, Label, Slider, CrossAxisAlignment};
///
/// let my_row = Flex::row()
///     .cross_axis_alignment(CrossAxisAlignment::Center)
///     .must_fill_main_axis(true)
///     .with_child(Label::new("hello"))
///     .with_default_spacer()
///     .with_flex_child(Slider::new(), 1.0);
/// ```
///
/// Construction with mutating methods
///
/// ```
/// use druid::widget::{Flex, FlexParams, Label, Slider, CrossAxisAlignment};
///
/// let mut my_row = Flex::row();
/// my_row.set_must_fill_main_axis(true);
/// my_row.set_cross_axis_alignment(CrossAxisAlignment::Center);
/// my_row.add_child(Label::new("hello"));
/// my_row.add_default_spacer();
/// my_row.add_flex_child(Slider::new(), 1.0);
